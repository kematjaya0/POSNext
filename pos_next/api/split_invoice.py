"""Split one POS sale into one Sales Invoice per company.

A branch (nextend Warehouse Group) can hold warehouses of several companies
(PT/CV) while running a single POS Profile. The cashier still rings up one
basket and takes one payment; this module decides which warehouse every row
ships from and bills each company on its own invoice:

* ``plan_sale`` - allocate every row that ships from the branch (session
  warehouse first, then the branch's other warehouses, oldest restock first),
  then group rows per company. A row that needs two warehouses becomes one
  invoice row per warehouse. A branch warehouse the cashier picked by hand is
  drawn first, unless POS Settings.store_stock_first says the session
  warehouse must run out first.
* ``submit_split_sale`` - create every invoice in the request's transaction,
  share the basket discount and the payment between them, and submit them all
  (or keep them all as drafts when a ``pos_next_split_hold`` hook says so).

The cart side stays one row per item + UOM; only the submitted payload is
split here, so promotions keep working on the whole basket.
